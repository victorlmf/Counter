# Counter 

This is a flask application that counts the number of times the page has been viewed. 

## Features

1. The root route renders a template that displays the number of times a user has visited this site. The number of "Visit(s)" increases everytime a user refreshes the page. 
2. Created a "Add two counts" button to increase the number of "Count(s)" when a user clicks the button. 
3. Created a form that allows the user to specify the increment of the counter and have the counter increment accordingly.
4. Created a "Reset" button for the "/destroy_session" route to clears all datas in the session and redirects to the root route.
